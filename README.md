## Getting Started
You can create Galactic Deploy Environments from a Bunnyshell Template; these Environments can have multiple purposes:

Development
Staging / Dev testing / End-to-end testing
Development Environments should be created with the dev target for images (see "Container images") and can be used for Remote Development.

Staging / Testing Environments should be created with the prod target for images, in order to have the application running as it does in production.
